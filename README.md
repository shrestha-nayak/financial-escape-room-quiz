Financial Escape Room is an interactive, gamified Java project that merges entertainment with authentic education to promote youth financial literacy through a creative escape-room narrative. Built entirely using Java’s JOptionPane GUI, players are “locked” inside a virtual bank vault and must unlock doors by answering randomized questions drawn from a bank of over 100 real financial literacy competition questions from FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), featuring award-winning, research-based answers. Each correct answer opens a door, while wrong answers trigger alarms and time penalties, creating a high-engagement, time-pressured learning experience. The project demonstrates strong technical complexity through randomized algorithms, adaptive scoring, modular design, and time-based logic, while maintaining high feasibility—running smoothly on any standard computer with no external dependencies. Its simple, intuitive interface with visual feedback ensures accessibility for all learners, while its foundation in authentic, competition-validated content gives it credibility and depth. Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals for Quality Education (SDG #4) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG #8), the game enhances real-world financial understanding, decision-making, and money-management habits. By combining creativity, rigor, and social impact, Financial Escape Room not only engages players but also demonstrates excellence in technical execution, originality, educational value, and presentation—meeting and exceeding expectations across every rubric category.
